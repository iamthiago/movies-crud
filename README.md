# Movies CRUD app

This is my first ever go app.

The idea is to start small with an in-memory data structure and grow it to use a database and eventually send notifications etc, making this a playground around the golang and it's capabilities.

# How to run it
Right now you can download the code and run on your machine using:
- go build
- go run main.go

That should bootstrap the server and you can hit the urls described in the routes section, currently in the main.go, which should be eventually moved to it's own file.
